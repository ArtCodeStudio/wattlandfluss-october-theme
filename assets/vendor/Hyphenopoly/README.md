# Hyphenopoly.js
Hyphenopoly.js is a JavaScript-polyfill for hyphenation in HTML.
There are two parts:
- Hyphenopoly_Loader.js (~4KB unpacked): checks if hyphenation of the requested language is supported on the client and loads Hyphenopoly.js (~34KB unpacked) and the specific language patterns (sizes differ) if necessary.
- Hyphenopoly.js and language-patterns: client-side hyphenation of text using Franklin M. Liangs hyphenation algorithm known from TeX.

# Hyphenopoly.js vs. Hyphenator.js
Hyphenator.js (https://github.com/mnater/Hyphenator) started 2007 and has evolved ever since.
But web browsers have evolved much more!
Almost all of them support native hyphenation (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens) for a specific set of languages (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens#Browser_compatibility). So it's time for something new!

Hyphenopoly.js is based on Hyphenator.js (they share some code) but - in favor of simplicity and speed – lacks many features of Hyphenator.js. Most of these features aren't needed in modern webdesign anymore:
- dropped support for usage as bookmarklet
- dropped support for frames
- dropped suppord for ancient browsers
- dropped caching of patterns in browser storage
- dropped breaking of non-textual content (urls, code etc.)
- and some more…

If you need one of those features use Hyphenator.js – or give some feedback and proof that the feature is really useful and should be implemented in Hyphenopoly.js

# Automatic hyphenation
The algorithm used for hyphenation was developped by Franklin M. Liang for TeX. It works more or less like this:

1. Load a set of precomputed language specific patterns. The patterns are stored in a structure called a trie, which is very efficient for this task.
2. Collect all patterns that are a substring of the word to be hyphenated.
3. Combine the numerical values between characters: higher values overwrite lower values.
4. Odd values are hyphenation points (except if the hyphenation point is left from leftmin and right from rightmin), replace them with a soft hyphen and drop the other values.
5. Repeat 2. - 4. for all words longer than minWordLength

Example:
````
Hyphenation
h y p h e n a t i o n
h y3p h
      h e2n
      h e n a4
      h e n5a t
         1n a
          n2a t
             1t i o
               2i o
                  o2n
h0y3p0h0e2n5a4t2i0o2n
Hy-phen-ation
````

The patterns are precomputed and available for many languages on CTAN. Hyphenopoly.js uses a slightly different format (compacted and with some metadata). Patterns are computed from a large list of hyphenated words by a program called patgen. They aim to find some hyphenation points – not all – because it's better to miss a hyphenation point then to have some false hyphenation points. Most patterns are really good but none is error free.

These pattern vary in size. English patterns are around 27KB (unzipped), german patterns 81KB and hungarian 465KB! This is mostly due to the different linguistic characteristics of the languages.

# Hyphenopoly.js – typical course of action
1. The (one and only) global variable "Hyphenopoly" is set. At this point it's an object containing the required languages.
2. Hyphenopoly_Loader.js is executed. It tests if the client it runs on supports native hyphenation for all of the required languages. If at least one of these languages isn't supported Hyphenopoly.js is loaded as well as all necessary language specific patterns.
3. When the document, Hyphenopoly.js and the pattern(s) are all loaded, text in the document gets hyphenated.


# FOUHC – Flash Of UnHyphenated Content
To prevent a Flash of UnHyphenated Content (FOUHC) while the browser is downloading resources, Hyphenator_Loader.js hides all content of the document until text is hyphenated. If something goes wrong the hiding times out after 1s.

# Usage
Place all code for Hyphenopoly at the top of the header (immediatly after the `<title>` tag) to ensure ressources are loaded as early as possible.
You'll have to insert two script blocks. In the first block provide the initial configurations for Hyphenopoly_Loader as inline script. In the second block load Hyphenopoly_Loader.js as external script.
Also, don't forget to enable CSS hyphenation.

Example:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <meta http-equiv="content-type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
        <title>Example 1</title>
        <script>
        var Hyphenopoly = {
            require: {
                "la": "honorificabilitudinitas"
            },
            paths: {
                patterndir: "../patterns/",
                maindir: "../"
            },
            setup: {
                classnames: {
                    "hyphenate": {}
                }
            }
        };
        </script>
        <script src="../Hyphenopoly_Loader.js"></script>
        <style type="text/css">
            .hyphenate {
                hyphens: auto;
                -ms-hyphens: auto;
                -moz-hyphens: auto;
                -webkit-hyphens: auto;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Example 1</h1>
        <p class="hyphenate" lang="la">Qua de causa Helvetii quoque reliquos Gallos virtute praecedunt, quod fere cotidianis proeliis cum Germanis contendunt, cum aut suis finibus eos prohibent aut ipsi in eorum finibus bellum gerunt.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```
Let's go through this example step by step:

## UTF-8
Make sure your page is encoded as utf-8.

## First script block – configurations
Hyphenopoly_Loader.js needs some information to run. This information is provided in a globally accessible Object called `Hyphenopoly`. Hyphenopoly_Loader.js and (if necessary) Hyphenopoly.js will add other methods and properties only to this object – there will be no other global variables/functions outside this object.

### require
The `Hyphenopoly` object must have exactly one property called `require` which is itself an object containing at least one nameValuePair where the name is a language code string (Some patterns are region-specific. See the patterns directory for supported languages. E.g. just using `en` won't work, use either `en-us`or `en-gb`) and the value is a long word string in that language (preferably more than 12 characters long).

Hyphenator_Loader.js will feature test the client (aka browser, aka user agent) for CSS-hyphens support for the given languages with the given words respectivly. In the example above it will test if the client supports CSS-hyphenation for latin. If your page contains more than just one language just add more lines.

If you want to force the usage of Hyphenopoly.js for a language (e.g. for testing purposes) write `"FORCEHYPHENOPOLY"` instead of the long word.

### paths
Hyphenopoly_Loader.js needs to know where hyphenation patterns and Hyphenopoly.js is located. Therefor the `Hyphenopoly` object must have exactly one property called `paths` containing an object with two properties:
- `patterndir` with the path of the directory containing the patterns
- `maindir` with the path of the directory containing Hyphenopoly.js

### setup
If Hyphenopoly.js is executed (either because the browser doesn't support the language provided in `require` or because you `FORCEHYPHENOPOLY`'d) setup defines what is hyphenated and how.
The `Hyphenopoly` object must have exactly one property called `setup` containing an object with keyValuePairs. There are many things you can set. Some configurations are general others are set per CSS class.

The `setup` object must at least have one property called `classnames`: an object containing all CSS classes you want to be hyphenated. Typically these are the same classes you use in CSS to enable hyphenation.

In the example above we configure Hyphenopoly.js to hyphenate all elements having the `hyphenate`-class without any special settings (the value is an empty object).

## Second script block – load and run Hyphenopoly_Loader.js
Hyphenopoly_Loader.js tests if the browser supports CSS hyphenation for the language(s) given in `Hyphenopoly.require`. If one of the given languages isn't supported it automatically hides the documents contents and loads Hyphenopoly.js and the necessary patterns. Hyphenopoly.js once loaded will hyphenate the elements according to the settings in `setup` and unhide the document when it's done. If something goes wrong and Hyphenopoly.js is unable to unhide the document Hyphenopoly_Loader.js has a timeout that kicks in after some time (defaults to 1000ms) and undhides the document and writes a message to the console.
If the browser supports all languages the script deletes the `Hyphenopoly`-object and terminates without further ado.
